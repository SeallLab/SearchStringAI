The following is what is supported for the google scholar search engine.

Boolean operators Section
This type of search uses operators that help you narrow or broaden your search. The most common operators are AND, OR, NOT.

Operator: AND
Finds both terms included in a search query, so it narrows down search results.
Example: library AND anxiety
Tips: Good practice when you want to combine more than one search terms. It needs to be in capital letters.

Operator: OR
Finds one or either terms included in a search query, so it expands search results.
Example:library (anxiety OR fear)
Tips: Good practice when there is more than one commonly used set of keywords that describe a topic. It needs to be in capital letters.

Example: NOT
Finds the first term included in a query but not the second, so it narrows down search results.
Example: library anxiety -graduate
Tips: Good practice when not useful words pop up in your results. Do not spell out the word NOT use the minus symbol or a hyphen (-) instead. Do not add a space after the hyphen. The search term you wish to exclude should appear immediately after it.

Operator: AROUND
Allows to search by proximity of words, so it narrows down search results.
Example: library anxiety AROUND (5) graduate

Tips: It should be written in capital letters. You can add spaces between the first search term(s), AROUND, the parenthesis with the number that indicates how close the next search term should appear in the results and the second search term(s).
