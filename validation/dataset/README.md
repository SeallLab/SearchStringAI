In this repository, we share our dataset that was used to analyse Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) in Software Engineering. The title of our potential work is:

# How Many Papers Should You Review? A Research Synthesis of Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering

We retrieved initial papers containing SLRs from Scopus on Feb 24, 2023 using particularly designed search string. We extracted the meta-data of the paper in which it is published (e.g. title, publication year, authors, publication venue, etc.). We used export feature of Scopus to do so. Moreover, the set of papers have gone through an inclusion/exclusion criteria and then we manually extracted the detailed data for each identified SLR (The final number of papers included in the review, the earliest year of the reviewed papers and the latest year of the reviewed papers). The uploaded version of the dataset is solely used in our analysis of the current work.

The data is presented in the tabular format and it contains seven columns. Following four columns present the data about the identified papers  

- ID: This column represents the unique identifier assigned to each SLR in our dataset. 
- Paper Title (Meta-data of the publication containing the SLR)
- Year (Meta-data of the publication containing the SLR)
- Venue (Meta-data of the publication containing the SLR): This columns shows the title of the journal for each SLR.

On the other hand, following columns represent the data that was extracted from each individual SLR:

- The (final) number of papers included in the review: This column shows the total number of papers that were primarily analyzed by each SLR.

- The earliest year of the reviewed papers: This column displays the earliest year of the primary studies that were included in the SLR .

- The latest year of the reviewed papers: This column shows the latest year for primary studies that were included in the SLR .
